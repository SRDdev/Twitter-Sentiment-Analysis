Welcome to the Twitter Sentiment Analysis Workshop repository! This single Jupyter Notebook encapsulates the entire process of sentiment analysis for Twitter tweets, demonstrated in a workshop focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP). This comprehensive notebook guides you through various stages of an NLP project tailored specifically for Twitter data.

## Notebook Contents

### 1. Data Acquisition
The first step involves obtaining Twitter data, laying the groundwork for subsequent analysis and model training. Follow the instructions in the notebook to gather relevant data for sentiment analysis.

### 2. Data Cleaning
Data quality is paramount for effective sentiment analysis. The notebook provides comprehensive data cleaning techniques to ensure accuracy by removing noise, irrelevant information, and inconsistencies.

### 3. Data Augmentation
Enhance the dataset's diversity and quality through data augmentation. This step enriches the dataset, contributing to a more robust and generalizable sentiment analysis model.

### 4. GloVe Training
Learn how to train GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) embeddings, a critical component of NLP models. The notebook guides you through the process of capturing meaningful word representations using GloVe.

### 5. GloVe Testing
Evaluate the effectiveness of the trained GloVe embeddings in the context of Twitter sentiment analysis. The testing phase provides insights into the performance of the model on sentiment-related tasks.
